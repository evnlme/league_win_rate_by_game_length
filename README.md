This is the corresponding code for a [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/p00ee8/champion_win_rate_vs_game_length/) I made in 2021.

I ported the code to Jupyter and verified it runs with the cached data. Unfortunately, LoLalytics retired the API that was used for the data. The cached data is downloadable in the release section. Since the package versions aren't frozen, results may vary between versions.
